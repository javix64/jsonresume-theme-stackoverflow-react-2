# Fork of jsonresume-theme-stackoverflow

I forked this and migrated it all to react. See the [`package.json`](./package.json) for the available scripts. Development should be done via the storybook.

## Storybook deployment

There is an automatic storybook [deployment](https://sb-stackoverflow-jsonresume-theme.netlify.app/).

## Handlebars example

There is an automatic [deployment]() of the local [example resuse](./src/storyResume.json) using the hold handlebars template for reference.
